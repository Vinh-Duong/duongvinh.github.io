👨🏻‍💻 I'm a Postdoc Researcher at the Sunkyunkwan University, South Korea.

🔬 My research interests are in deep learning and machine learning applied to image/video coding and restoration frameworks!

📚 I'm currently working on light field coding and restoration methods.

📽️ I have a keen interest in various other topics, such as unsupervised image denoising, single image super-resolution, and depth estimation, and I am continually exploring new research topics.
