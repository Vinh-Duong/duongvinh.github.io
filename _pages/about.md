I'm a Postdoc Researcher at [Digital Media Lab](https://media.skku.ac.kr/dml/index.do), Sunkyunkwan University, South Korea. I received my Ph.D. degree at [Sunkyunkwan University](https://www.skku.edu/eng/) (SKKU), under the supervision of Prof. [Byeungwoo Jeon](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j_9mzdEAAAAJ&hl=en). Before joining SKKU, I worked with Prof. [Van Duc Nguyen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tLY0LZ8AAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Tien Hoa Nguyen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B7sDxxIAAAAJ&hl=en) and received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electrical and Telecommunications from [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn/en/) (HUST) in 2017.

# Research 
* My primary research interests are about deep learning and machine learning applied to image/video coding and restoration frameworks!

* I'm currently working on light field coding and restoration methods.

* I have a keen interest in various other topics, such as unsupervised image denoising, single image super-resolution, and depth estimation, and I am continually exploring new research topics.
